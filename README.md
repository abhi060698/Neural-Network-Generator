# Neural-Network-Generator
Code to create an MLP in keras using the sequential model. Only the parameters of the neural net are required, and the keras neural net is generated based on these entries. ANN.py contains two classes, ANN and Retrain. ANN is used to create neural networks from scratch, whereas Retrain is used to fine tune pre-trained neural networks.
